Collectors are functions that return a new object instance of type [`TerminalStage`](../stages/TerminalStage.ts).

## Example usage

```typescript
import { LazyPipeline } from 'lazy-pipeline';
import { allMatch } from 'lazy-pipeline/collectors';
import { limit } from 'lazy-pipeline/operators';

const source = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

const result = LazyPipeline.from(source)
  .add(
    /*
     * Only take the first 3 elements.
     */
    limit(3)
  )
  .collect(
    /**
     * `allMatch() collector returns whether all remaining elements in this pipeline are even numbers.
     */
    allMatch(e => e % 2 === 0)
  );

console.log(result); // Outputs `true`.
```

| [`max`](./max/max.ts)                   | Return a terminal stage that finds the max element in the pipeline. By default, if no comparator function is provided, it assumes every element to be numeric, if at least one element is not numeric, then it will throw an error.

By default, if no comparator function is provided, it assumes every element to be numeric, if at least one element is not numeric, then it will throw an error. If a comparator function is provided, it will use the returned value of the comparator as the min.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
