Operators are functions that return a new object instance of type [`IntermediateStage`](../stages/IntermediateStage.ts).

## Example usage

```typescript
import { LazyPipeline } from 'lazy-pipeline';
import { toArray } from 'lazy-pipeline/collectors';
import { limit } from 'lazy-pipeline/operators';

const source = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

const result = LazyPipeline.from(source)
  .add(
    /*
     * `limit()` operator returns a intermediate stage instance that only allows the first n elements to pass through
     * the pipeline, in this case, only 3 elements are let through.
     */
    limit(3)
  )
  .collect(
    /**
     * `toArray()` collector accumulates all remaining pipeline elements into an array and returns the resulting array.
     */
    toArray()
  );

console.log(result); // Outputs `[2, 4, 6]`.
```

| [`sorted<IN>(comparator?: (left: IN, right: IN) => number): IntermediateStage<IN, IN>`](./sorted/sorted.ts) | Return an intermediate stage that sorts the elements in this pipeline. This stage will accumulate all the elements before performing the sort, after that, it will resuming the pipeline by sending the sorted elements down the pipeline. <br/><br/>If no comparator function is provided, then the sorting behavior is the same as that of `Array.prototype.sort` where elements are compared by their character code points, otherwise, sorting behavior is dictated by the provided comparator where a returned value of `-1` indicates that the left element should come before the right element, `1` indicates that the left element should come after the right element, and `0` indicates equality. |
| [`takeWhile<IN>(predicate: (element: IN) => boolean): IntermediateStage<IN, IN>`](./takeWhile/takeWhile.ts) | Return an intermediate stage that consumes elements in the pipeline as long as the provided predicate is `true`. As soon as the predicate returns `false`, this stage will no longer execute even if the predicate returns `true` for subsequent elements down the pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
